# Deep Learning
Supplemental files for the Deep Learning workshop, presented by the IDEA Student Center of UC San Diego.

## Requirements
- python 3.5
- numpy
- tensorflow 1.0.0
- jupyter

**NOTE:** Python 2.7 should work on macOS and Linux, but only Python 3.5 is supported for TensorFlow on Windows.


## Installation
If you previously installed Python using Anaconda, you can install the required packages using the following commands:

### macOS
1. open Terminal.app
2. run the following commands in the terminal (type each line and hit enter):
    1. create a new Anaconda environment: ``conda create -n tensorflow python=3.5 numpy scipy matplotlib jupyter pip``
    2. activate the environment: ``source activate tensorflow``
    3. install TensorFlow: ``pip install --upgrade tensorflow``

### Windows
1. open the Anaconda Command Prompt
2. run the following commands in the terminal (type each line and hit enter):
    1. create a new Anaconda environment: ``conda create -n tensorflow python=3.5 numpy scipy matplotlib jupyter pip``
    2. activate the environment: ``activate tensorflow``
    3. install TensorFlow: ``pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/windows/cpu/tensorflow-1.0.0-cp35-cp35m-win_x86_64.whl``

If you run into an error installing TensorFlow 1.0.0, try installing version 0.12.0 instead:
- ``pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/windows/cpu/tensorflow-0.12.0-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl``


### Linux
1. open a terminal program
2. run the following commands in the terminal (type each line and hit enter):
    1. create a new Anaconda environment: ``conda create -n tensorflow python=3.5 numpy scipy matplotlib jupyter pip``
    2. activate the environment: ``source activate tensorflow``
    3. install TensorFlow: ``pip install --upgrade tensorflow``


### Testing the installation
To test the installation (for macOS, Windows or Linux), run the following commands in the same terminal from above:
- start python and load TensorFlow: ``python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)"``

You should see output similar to the following:
```bash
> python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)"
1.0.0
```

**NOTE:** Make sure you have the Anaconda environment activated before running the above test command. If you don't, the command will fail as it will not "know" where to look for the TensorFlow install.


### Non-Anaconda installation
If you did not previously install Python using Anaconda, then you can follow the installation instructions listed in the official TensorFlow documentation: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/
